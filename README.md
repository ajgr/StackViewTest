# StackViewTest
A simple Mac OS app demonstrating how to add views to an NSStackView programmatically.


The NSStackView is embedded in an NSScrollView on the main storyboard file. Views are added dynamically from an external (to the storyboard) xib.

This project was done in Xcode 7 and tested under Mac OS 10.11.
